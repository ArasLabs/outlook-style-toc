# Outlook Style TOC

Changes the standard Table-of-Contents navigation to look and behave like Outlook navigation.

### Interview with the developer:

#### What the motivator was for the solution?
Since Aras is a very well thought out program based on the Microsoft look and feel, I thought that it would be nice to use the base menu system that Microsoft uses in its B2B applications. Plus I thought since we are an Open User it would be nice to contribute back.

#### Who participated in development (1 guy vs a team etc)?
I am the one who developed the menu system.

#### How it was built, not the secret sauce but the basics (coding vs configuration, etc)?
I had much of the code built for a previous project that I was working on, and after some exploratory searching through Aras's code I saw that a call was being made to attach an xslt stylesheet using the xml from a previous call in the script.

I used Nash and caught the XML code and created a stylesheet that would output the menu as you see today. I then altered the mainTree.html to allow for the functionality needed. The whole process was not has hard has it would seem because I created the menu to use the functions already in place.

#### Any other snipits you think would be valuable to share?
I am sending an updated version of the menu system â€“ now keeps the highlighted menus after you click off the menu.
I am also working on the inBasket to allow certain administrative persons to look at other inBaskets to help with problems. Again, much of the code is ready from Aras, it is just a matter of implementing the change.
